		  <strong>#2: </strong>
		  <p>     Finally, I've decided to write it down.
			  I don't know where this will lead me, but I am going to do it.
			  
			  I just finished the seventh episode of Mr. Robot's adventure,
			  which was published through a collaboration between USA Network, Universal Cable Production,
			  and Anonymous Content. What a psychologically compelling show! It revolves around a seemingly robotic,
			  eccentric young man named Elliot who starts hacking ALLSAFE to help the community.
			  However, there seems to be no clear mind to assist him. I love Elliot,
			  but sometimes I want to kill him for the sake of him. In the last few days,
			  I've been considering creating a database to introduce my old friends to new ones and vice versa.
			  This would enable us to travel more affordably and continue our adventures together.
			  But then I thought, am I hacking them? What's the difference between a mafia crime network and a family organization? 
			  Considering my inner point of view, it hurry me to design a journey plan that would lead me to an endless curiosity,
			  through the spotless minds of my friends, in both the past and future, and also night and day dreamings.
			  It would be like Alice crawling on all fours to follow White Rabbit.
			  
			  Have you watched "Alice in Wonderland 1951"? I traveled to this wonderland with Alice today again for the 2nd time, 
			  and I still see glimpses of this wonder with me.
			  Have you ever chased the white rabbit? Have you ever had an unbirthday party? Have you ever tried mushrooms?
			  I guess you have, but it's possible that you never mentioned your experience in any of your essays or articles.
			  You cannot rationalize your wonder in logical forms. Most of us take it too seriously, and that's how we lose our beautiful minds.

			  I don't know where this will lead me, but I am going to do it.
			  
			  After a while of playing and watching some games, I realized it was pointless to fight seriously.
			  We should only fight like animals to get our food and ensure our survival on this planet.
			  We go to school to learn how to do this in respect to our culture and society. That's all we do it for, in terms of humanity.
			  But what if we traveled to a new world? Utopia, paradise, or hell. It doesn't matter where, just think about any other world.
