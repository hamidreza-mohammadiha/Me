	      <strong><i>GameTheory: The Problem </i></strong>
		  <p>This chapter introduces the basic concepts and definitions of game theory, such as players, strategies, payoffs, outcomes, and equilibria. It also explains the main types and classifications of games, such as normal form, extensive form, simultaneous, sequential, zero-sum, non-zero-sum, symmetric, asymmetric, and repeated games. It also discusses the main problems and challenges that game theory aims to address, such as how to model rational behavior, how to predict and explain the outcomes of strategic interactions, and how to design and implement mechanisms that achieve desirable social goals.</p>
		  <br>
		      <i>"Game theory is the name given to the methodology of using mathematical tools to model
			and analyze situations of interactive decision making. These are situations involving
			several decision makers (called players) with different goals, in which the decision of
			each affects the outcome for all the decision makers. This interactivity distinguishes game
			theory from standard decision theory, which involves a single decision maker, and it is
			its main focus. Game theory tries to predict the behavior of the players and sometimes
			also provides decision makers with suggestions regarding ways in which they can achieve
			their goals.
			The foundations of game theory were laid down in the book The Theory of Games and
			Economic Behavior, published in 1944 by the mathematician John von Neumann and the
			economist Oskar Morgenstern. The theory has been developed extensively since then and
			today it has applications in a wide range of fields. The applicability of game theory is due
			to the fact that it is a context-free mathematical toolbox that can be used in any situation
			of interactive decision making."</i> </p>

			<code> <div id=“game-theory-problems”> <strong>Classical Game Theory Problems</strong> <p>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It is used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science, and biology. Here are some examples of classical game theory problems that illustrate the main concepts and applications of game theory.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Prisoner’s Dilemma</strong>: This is a game that involves two prisoners who are interrogated separately by the police. Each prisoner can either cooperate with the other by remaining silent, or defect by confessing and implicating the other. The payoffs depend on the choices of both prisoners. If both cooperate, they each get a light sentence. If both defect, they each get a harsh sentence. If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator gets the harshest sentence and the defector gets the lightest sentence. The dilemma is that, although both prisoners would be better off if they both cooperated, each prisoner has an incentive to defect, regardless of what the other does. This leads to a suboptimal outcome where both defect and get a harsh sentence. The prisoner’s dilemma is often used to model situations where individuals face a trade-off between personal and collective interests, such as in public goods provision, environmental protection, or arms races. </li><br><li><strong>The Chicken Game</strong>: This is a game that involves two drivers who are heading towards each other on a collision course. Each driver can either swerve or stay straight. The payoffs depend on the choices of both drivers. If both swerve, they each get a small payoff. If both stay straight, they both crash and get a large negative payoff. If one swerves and the other stays straight, the swerver gets a large negative payoff and the straight driver gets a large positive payoff. The game is called chicken because it resembles a situation where two people challenge each other to see who will chicken out first. The game has multiple equilibria, where either driver swerves and the other stays straight. However, there is no dominant strategy for either driver, as each driver prefers to do the opposite of what the other does. The chicken game is often used to model situations where there is a conflict of interest and a potential for escalation, such as in nuclear deterrence, brinkmanship, or bargaining. </li> <br> <li><strong>The Battle of the Sexes</strong>: This is a game that involves a couple who want to go out for the evening, but have different preferences over where to go. The husband prefers to go to a football match, while the wife prefers to go to a ballet. The payoffs depend on the choices of both spouses. If they both go to the same place, they each get a positive payoff, but the payoff is higher for the spouse who gets their preferred choice. If they go to different places, they each get a negative payoff. The game has multiple equilibria, where either the husband or the wife gets their preferred choice and the other goes along. However, there is no dominant strategy for either spouse, as each spouse prefers to go to the same place as the other, but also prefers their own choice over the other’s choice. The game is called the battle of the sexes because it resembles a situation where a couple has to coordinate on a common activity, but also has conflicting interests. The game is often used to model situations where there is a need for coordination and communication, such as in team formation, coalition building, or voting. </li></ul> </div> </code>

	     <strong><i>GameDesign: The Model </i></strong>
	      	      <br>
		      <br>This chapter explains how game design is a process of creating a model of a game, which is a simplified representation of the game’s system, rules, and elements. It also discusses how game design is influenced by various factors, such as the game’s goals, audience, platform, and genre. It gives examples of different types of game models, such as paper prototypes, digital prototypes, and mathematical models. It also offers some tips and guidelines for creating and evaluating game models.<br>
		      <br>
		      <i>"We must be absolutely clear on this point before we can proceed. The game is not 
			the experience. The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience. This 
			is a hard concept for some people to grasp. The ancient Zen question addresses this 
			directly: “If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a 
			sound?” This has been repeated so often that it sounds hackneyed, but it is exactly
			what we are talking about. If our definition of “sound” is air molecules vibrating, 
			then yes, the tree makes a sound. If our definition of sound is the experience of hearing a sound, then the answer is no, the tree makes no sound when no one is there. 
			As designers, we don’t really care about the tree and how it falls—we care only 
			about the experience of hearing it. The tree is just a means to an end. And if no one 
			is there to hear it, well, we don’t care at all."</i> </p>

			we used to do on the outside, in “reality,” won’t be happening anymore, or won’t be happening in the same way. You

			<code> <p>GamePlay is a term used to describe the way a game is played. It is the specific way in which players interact with a game, and in particular with video games. 
				GamePlay is the pattern defined through the game rules, connection between player and the game, challenges and overcoming them, plot and player’s connection with it. 
				GamePlay is what makes a game enjoyable and engaging for players. GamePlay can be divided into several types, such as cooperative, competitive, casual, hardcore, etc.
			</p> <p>Here are some quotes that relate to GamePlay:</p>
				<ul> <li><strong>“Games are a series of interesting choices.” - Sid Meier</strong>: This quote suggests that GamePlay is about making decisions that have meaningful consequences and affect the outcome of the game.
					A good game should offer the player multiple options and trade-offs, and make them think strategically and creatively.</li> 
					<br>
					<li><strong>“The game is not a game if you don’t play it.” - Gary Gygax</strong>: This quote implies that GamePlay is about actively participating and engaging with the game, rather than passively observing or consuming it. 
					A good game should invite the player to explore, experiment, and express themselves through the game.</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>“Play is the highest form of research.” - Albert Einstein</strong>: This quote indicates that GamePlay is about learning and discovering new things through the game, as well as having fun and being curious.
					A good game should challenge the player to acquire new skills, knowledge, and insights through the game.</li> </ul>
				
				<p>Some scientific research that has studied GamePlay are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Science of Video Games: Immersion, Flow, and Presence</strong>: 
					This article reviews some of the research that has explored how video games can create immersive, flow, and presence experiences for players, and how these experiences can affect their cognition, emotion, and behavior.
					Immersion is the degree to which the player feels absorbed and involved in the game world. Flow is the state of optimal experience where the player feels fully focused and motivated by the game.
					Presence is the sense of being in the game world and interacting with it as if it were real.</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Research Methodology in Gaming: An Overview</strong>: This article introduces a range of research methodologies and aims to promote interdisciplinary dialogue in the study of games, play, and game design. 
					It covers topics such as collaborative research, contextual research, game design research, interdisciplinarity, ludology, natural language processing, pervasive games, play as a method, prototyping, psychophysiological measuring, research methods, and social constructionism.</li> 
					<br>
					<li><strong>Digital Games for Science Learning and Scientific Literacy</strong>: This article examines how digital games can be used to support science learning and scientific literacy. 
					It discusses the potential benefits and challenges of using games for science education, and provides some examples of games that have been designed or used for this purpose. 
					It also suggests some directions for future research and development in this area.</li> </ul> </code>

		  <strong>My Thesis Innovation: </strong>
		  <p>    The user is requesting a game theoretical explanation for how being irrational can lead to winning in certain economic games.
			  In game theory, there are various types of games, including zero-sum games, non-zero-sum games, and cooperative games.
			  In some non-zero-sum games, being irrational can actually be an advantage.
			  For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, two players are faced with the decision to either cooperate or defect.
			  If both players cooperate, they both receive a moderate payoff.
			  If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives a high payoff while the cooperator receives a low payoff.
			  If both players defect, they both receive a low payoff.
			  The rational strategy in this game is to defect, as it provides the highest payoff regardless of what the other player does.
			  However, if both players adopt this strategy, they both end up with a low payoff.
			  On the other hand, if both players choose to cooperate, they both receive a moderate payoff.
			  In this case,
			  being irrational and choosing to cooperate even though it is not the rational choice can lead to a better outcome for both players.
			  This is because the irrational choice of cooperation can signal trustworthiness and lead to a more cooperative relationship in future interactions.
			  Therefore, in certain economic games, being irrational can be a winning strategy if it leads to better long-term outcomes.

			  As always, I'm really confused about the reality and it's beyond. I was dreaming of a boy who has great genius but he was trying to ignore himself.
			  He can write and can talk but cannot find out the main point. He kept his mind for a long time but he was scared of almost everything except his curiosity.

		  <p>     Finally, I've decided to write it down.
			  I don't know where this will lead me, but I am going to do it.
			  
			  I just finished the seventh episode of Mr. Robot's adventure,
			  which was published through a collaboration between USA Network, Universal Cable Production,
			  and Anonymous Content. What a psychologically compelling show! It revolves around a seemingly robotic,
			  eccentric young man named Elliot who starts hacking ALLSAFE to help the community.
			  However, there seems to be no clear mind to assist him. I love Elliot,
			  but sometimes I want to kill him for the sake of him. In the last few days,
			  I've been considering creating a database to introduce my old friends to new ones and vice versa.
			  This would enable us to travel more affordably and continue our adventures together.
			  But then I thought, am I hacking them? What's the difference between a mafia crime network and a family organization? 
			  Considering my inner point of view, it hurry me to design a journey plan that would lead me to an endless curiosity,
			  through the spotless minds of my friends, in both the past and future, and also night and day dreamings.
			  It would be like Alice crawling on all fours to follow White Rabbit.
			  
			  Have you watched "Alice in Wonderland 1951"? I traveled to this wonderland with Alice today again for the 2nd time, 
			  and I still see glimpses of this wonder with me.
			  Have you ever chased the white rabbit? Have you ever had an unbirthday party? Have you ever tried mushrooms?
			  I guess you have, but it's possible that you never mentioned your experience in any of your essays or articles.
			  You cannot rationalize your wonder in logical forms. Most of us take it too seriously, and that's how we lose our beautiful minds.

			  After a while of playing and watching some games, I realized it was pointless to fight seriously.
			  We should only fight like animals to get our food and ensure our survival on this planet.
			  We go to school to learn how to do this in respect to our culture and society. That's all we do it for, in terms of humanity.
			  But what if we traveled to a new world? Utopia, paradise, or hell. It doesn't matter where, just think about any other world.
