        <p>First of all, I should say that I'm trying to develop my imagination here, and you may see some semi-finished designs.
          That would be a sign that you we are looking at this page simultaneously.

        <br>
        <p>Sometimes a glance, an endeavor, or a story can be so inspiring and mesmerizing that it leaves you unable to think about anything else.
          This book had the same effect on me.
          It offers a new perspective that encourages us to look more closely and patiently at our own creations and those of others.
          Ultimately, it inspired me to create this channel and discuss game design.
          The basis for most of my thoughts is this wonderful book "The Art of Game Design" by Jesse Schell.</p>

      <p>When you brainstorm with other people, it is a very different experience than brainstorming alone.
         Finding the right brainstorming partner can make a world of dif
         ference—sometimes the two of you can get to great solutions many times faster 
        than either of you could alone, as you bounce ideas back and forth and complete one another’s sentences.
         Just having someone to talk out loud to, even if they say 
        nothing, can sometimes move the process along faster. Do keep in mind that adding 
        more and more people doesn’t necessarily help, though. Usually, small groups of no 
        more than four are best. Groups work best when brainstorming a narrow problem, 
        not a broad, open-ended one. And, honestly, most groups go about brainstorming all 
        wrong. Research shows that a group just showing up in a room trying to brainstorm 
        cold on an idea is a recipe for wasted time. Much better is to have each individual 
        brainstorm independently first and only then get together to share ideas, mix and 
        match them, and solve problems together. Also, certain people make bad brainstorming partners—these are usually people who try to poke holes in every idea or people 
        who have very narrow tastes. These people are best avoided, and you’ll be more 
        productive without them.
