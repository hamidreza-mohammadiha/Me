        <p>Turning points in life will only make sense when we look at the story from the end.
           These pivotal moments, at times, alter the course of our destiny, causing many branches of the tree of life to remain untouched,
           fading away into the oblivion of forgotten opportunities.
           The only time we can reach out to the distant ends is when we first place our feet on the robust branches.
           A branch that is endorsed by reason and logic, and guided by emotions and feelings.

          Within the realms of psychology and economics, we delve into the intricacies of human behavior, examining goal-directed and habitual behavior. Experts assert that the former is rooted in self-awareness, while the latter arises from the unconscious mind. Although a gray area exists between them, scientists and researchers have established their command center in the realm of self-awareness, whereas artists entrust this command center to their unconscious. Now, I must explore my own personality to ascertain which group I align with more and understand what motivates me in life, as well as why I seek to study and work in your esteemed institution and country. Allow me to share a brief story and then delve into my motivations.
            <br><br>My formative years were spent in Abhar, a mountainous city in Iran, surrounded by a circle of educated, creative, and professional teachers and mentors, including my father. My passion for gymnastics, Taekwondo, and volleyball was insatiable. I delved into mathematics and physics, earning a place at the country's premier university which was Sharif University of Technology.
            <br><br>During my undergraduate studies in industrial engineering, I developed a relatively comprehensive insight into the world of probability and optimization concepts, which proved to be of great assistance in nurturing my problem-solving and analytical skills. As a famous saying goes, this field is like a one-centimeter-deep ocean, but it can drown you. In the 21st century, with the accumulation and management of data, both large and small, this ocean has reverberated in the databases of various governmental and non-governmental organizations. Those with a broader perspective on processes and mechanisms will be able to extract this new and vital oil.
            <br><br>After starting my master's without entrance exam at that university, I accepted the role of leader for the Gaming2021 team, and together, we crafted a serious game designed to teach the complexities of industrial engineering in supply chain and business management. This game became a significant student event in Iran, attracting 967 players from across the country to engage in a challenging and entertaining competition.
            <br><br>In the two years since that event, I have immersed myself in diverse subjects that are loosely related to game philosophy. I have explored game theory, economic principles, game design literature, board games, and gamification in advertising, among various other intriguing areas. This enthusiasm led me to one of the biggest FMCG companies in Iran named Solico Group, where I have been working in different positions with the aim of exploring gamification in various departments.
            <br><br>And Now, I'm working for a Credit Scoring Company, As a Product Developer.
